Install the Tweepy library by running "pip install tweepy" in your terminal.

Develop the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Flask allows you to serve static files, so create the required HTML templates and static files. You can choose a suitable WYSIWYG editor for content creation.

Use MongoDB as the database to store scheduled tweets. Set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection in your Flask application. Create the necessary collections and fields to store the scheduled tweets.

Implement the post scheduling feature using the Tweepy library. Schedule tweets for specific dates and times, and store them in the MongoDB database. Create the required routes in Flask to handle tweet scheduling.

Enable manual login to Twitter by integrating the Twitter OAuth 2.0 flow. Allow users to log in with their Twitter accounts and obtain the necessary access tokens for posting tweets, creating threads, and inserting images. Implement the required functionality in Flask.

Implement the content creation feature, including the ability to make threads and insert images into Twitter posts. Utilize the Tweepy library to handle these actions based on user input. Ensure the necessary routes are in place to handle content creation.

Implement additional analytics and reporting features using popular metrics and data related to tweets. Use data analysis libraries like pandas and matplotlib to analyze tweet performance, including engagement, reach, and sentiment analysis. Customize the metrics according to your requirements.

Thoroughly test your application to ensure it functions as expected. Once testing is complete, deploy the application to a recommended hosting service like Heroku, which provides easy deployment for Flask applications.
